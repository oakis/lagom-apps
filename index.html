    <p><strong>What are cookies?</strong><br>
        We may collect information using &ldquo;cookies.&rdquo; Cookies are small data files stored on the hard drive of
        your computer or mobile device by a App. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web
        browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide
        you with a more personal and interactive experience on our App.</p>
    <p>We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile
        device, which are used only by us to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our App; and (2)
        third party cookies, which are served by service providers on our App, and can be used by such service providers
        to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other Apps.<br>

    <h1>Earnings Disclaimer</h1>
    <p>While we make every effort to ensure that we accurately represent all the products and services reviewed on this
        App and their potential for income, it should be noted that earnings and income statements made by Shape
        Esthetic and its advertisers / sponsors are estimates only of what we think you can possibly earn. There is no
        guarantee that you will make these levels of income and you accept the risk that the earnings and income
        statements differ by individual.</p>
    <p>As with any business, your results may vary, and will be based on your individual capacity, business experience,
        expertise, and level of desire. There are no guarantees concerning the level of success you may experience. The
        testimonials and examples used are exceptional results, which do not apply to the average purchaser, and are not
        intended to represent or guarantee that anyone will achieve the same or similar results. Each individual&rsquo;s
        success depends on his or her background, dedication, desire and motivation.</p>
    <p>Any claims made on this site of actual earnings or examples of actual results can be verified upon request. Your
        level of success in attaining the results claimed in our materials depends on the time you devote to the
        programs, ideas and techniques mentioned, your finances, previous knowledge and various skills. Since these
        factors differ according to individuals, we cannot guarantee your success or income level. Nor are we
        responsible for any of your actions.</p>
    <p>Materials in the product and on our App may contain information that includes or is based upon forward-looking
        statements within the meaning of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-Looking Statements give
        our expectations or forecasts of future events. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not
        relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such Forward Looking Statements use words such as
        &quot;anticipate,&quot; &quot;estimate,&quot; &quot;expect,&quot; &quot;project,&quot; &quot;intend,&quot;
        &quot;plan,&quot; &quot;believe,&quot; and other such words and terms of similar meaning in connection with a
        description of potential earnings or financial performance. Your Results May Vary from ours and those of anyone
        else who is, or will be using these products, techniques, and/or services.</p>
    <p>Any and all forward looking statements here or on any of our sales material are intended to express our opinion
        of earnings potential not actual earnings expected. Many factors will be important in determining your actual
        results and no guarantees are made, expressed or implied that you will achieve results similar to ours or
        anybody else's. In fact no guarantees are made that you will achieve any results from our ideas and techniques
